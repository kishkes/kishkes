👋 Hi, I’m @kishkes AKA Arman. 

🤠 Fun Fact - kishkes is a traditional Ashkenazi dish consisting of stuffed beef belly typically served with cholent (a hearty stew). Kishkes are delicious! 

🤓 I chose this name for my GitHub because I want to really get into the "guts" of computer networking, C programming, pen-testing, and more!

I am using Github to showcase my 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓽𝓪𝓫𝓾𝓵𝓸𝓾𝓼 projects.
